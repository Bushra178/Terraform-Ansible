1)to see the plan of action, what terraform is gonna do, gives same output as apply command but doesn't execute 
terraform plan

2)for all yes
terraform apply -auto-approve

3)delete everything
terraform destroy

4)see all data about resources
terraform state
terraform state show <resource-name>

5) pass variable
a)if we don't pass any value, we'll have to enter it by cmd prmpt
b)we can pass it as 'terraform apply -var "name=value"'
c) make a file terraform.tfvars and put all variables in there, if we name the file anthing other than terraform we have to define it like
terraform apply -var-file <file-name>
d) we can pass default value in variable in case there isn't any value defined default will be used. We can define variable type as well.
we can declare an array or list of objects of variables and get them like [0]
